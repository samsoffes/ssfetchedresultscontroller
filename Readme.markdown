# SSFetchedResultsController

Fork of [SafeFetchedResultsController by Deusty](http://deusty.blogspot.com/2010/02/more-bugs-in-nsfetchedresultscontroller.html). I've only made a few minor changes to eliminate warnings and such.

Read [Deusty's blog post](http://deusty.blogspot.com/2010/02/more-bugs-in-nsfetchedresultscontroller.html) about this class. There is a lot of detail and sample project you can try.
